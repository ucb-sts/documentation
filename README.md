This HTML is auto-generated with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

The original directory structure (for the master branch) was auto-generated
with `sphinx-apidoc  -F -H STS -A "Colin Scott" -V 0.1  -o docs /path/to/sts`

The results are generated in a _build/html directory. To host the generated
HTML on github, switch over to the gh-pages branch, and copy over the
generated HTML from the master branch. Pushing to the gh-pages branch will
automatically cause the new content to show up on
http://ucb-sts.github.io/documentation/ 

TODO(cs): this is awkward, as currently this requires us to copy the repository so that we can
access both branches at once.
